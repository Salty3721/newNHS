Camp wishes is a day camp for children with special needs that is on Saturdays from 12-4. Please arrive at the Wayne PAL at 11:45. All volunteers must sign up atleast 48 hours in advance for this event. If possible, please volunteer multiple weeks in a row so you have a chance to meet the children and they can be comfortable with you! You will be working with them to do puzzles, art projects, read books, and sports activities. Male volunteers are encouraged!
Please contact Alli Cadematori at academatori@gmail.com with any questions.
